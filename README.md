Play 2.5.12 + Angular 2.x with Angular-CLI + SBT - based build
======================================================================

This template contains standard distribution of **Play Framework 2.5.12** along with UI built with **Angular 2.x**.

Angular 2 application is contained in separate directory `ui` and is scaffolded using Angular-CLI. I've found WebJars and Sbt-Web based frontend build to be too slow and limited for my liking, so SBT is linked with Angular-CLI to handle frontend build.

Build requirements
------------------

- node: ^6.3.0
- npm: ^3.10.0
- angular-cli: @latest
- Chrome (for tests)

These three are required globally. `sbt-js-engine` will not be supported (and why should it - it's not like you can develop in Angular without node and npm anyway).

Changes and things to know
--------------------------

There are some small albeit important deviations from standard distribution of **PF 2.5.12** and they are mostly related to **sbt build** and **testing harness**:

- scala version was changed to 2.11.8 from 2.11.7
- all sbt-web plugins were removed from `project/plugins.sbt` since Angular-CLI now handles frontend build
- Play run hook `UIBuildHook` was added to `project/` - it's job is handling node modules installation via `npm` and `npm run build` when Play is run in dev mode.
- `build.sbt` file contains UI build tasks: npm modules installation and karma tests running along with Play tests
- `ui/dist` folder is listed as unmanaged resource directory, therefore both Play running in dev mode and stage/dist packages have access to it's contents via `Assets` controller. That folder is obviously output directory of Angular-CLI build.
- `IntegrationSpec` was removed, as Selenium Webdriver driven E2E tests are useless due to Protractor integration.
- Protractor testing is handled using `ProtractorSpec` test class in `test`. I owe that part to unnamed chinese coder who already battled with the idea of running Protractor tests from SBT and failed, so that I didn't have to. Thank you buddy!
- Changes in `ui` folder don't cause Play reloads, but are observed (and handled) by Angular-CLI when Play is running in dev mode.
- Protractor and Angular 2 unit tests require Chrome as ChromeDriver is supported out-of-the-box by Angular-CLI (I will work on making phantomjs default headless test-runner again).

About the Angular 2 app:

- If you want to serve Angular 2 app without Play you can do so by issuing `npm run start` in `ui/` directory - this will run `ng serve`
- As you probably noticed I am using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) via Angular-CLI CSS Preprocessors support (cause it's awesome!)

Migration from older version of this seed:

- Rules of [angular-cli update](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/Upgrading-from-Beta.10-to-Beta.14) apply to your ui project
- Try to match the structure of new `ui` directory
- Refactor tests to use `TestBed` instead of `inject`, use `async` tests for Zone.js async tracking
- Most probably `main.ts` will need some refactoring to match new one - we're using Angular 2 modules now.

Good luck!
